My mission is to apply technical tools and tested strategies to develop actionable insight for projects that have a positive change in how we live.  My projects will question assumptions (including my own) and aggregate the necessary data to test them.  As I learn, I will update my world view and propose the best solutions.  My projects reflect my personal development toward the following values:

**A Culture of Data**
To develop a truer view of the world, I use available data to properly test assumptions.  Metrics are defined and examined to develop insight and solve challenges.  Plato wrote: *"The unexamined life is not a life worth living."*  In my work I hope to let relevant data guide the examination of important questions and challenges to make a positive impact in our lives.

**Communication and Collaboration**
To help educate myself and others, I share code, results, insights, sources, collaboration, resources, and any other useful information in my posts.  I also share my social media outlets for additional communication, so please reach out.  Working together to solve problems we can accomplish so much more.

**Financial Education**
To develop the ability to effectively manage assets, I develop strategies inspired by those who have succeeded in areas of finance.  I develop metrics to help navigate various strategies and risk my own resources for investments when available.  I hope to one day share any successful financial growth strategies I learn with those who will most benefit from strong financial education and guidance.

**Developments in Technology**
To develop more efficient processes, I use technological advances where possible.  These can include advances in hard or cloud computing, application programming, web services, automation, API resources, machine learning, and quantum computing.

**Relevance**
To build things that have a positive impact, I work on challenges widely regarded.  This can include business processes, companies, financial markets, modern trends, technologies, scientific endeavors, artistic creations, social issues, and political implications.

These are the things I find important and I work hard to make contributions wherever possible.
