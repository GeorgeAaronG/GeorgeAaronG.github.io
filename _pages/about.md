Hello :)

I'm George, a junior data scientist from Texas ethusiastic about exploratory analysis, machine learning, data visualization and communication.  I'm currently working toward an M.S. in Business Analytics from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.  When I'm not working part time with my sales team down the road, I'm collaborating with my professional classmates online to tackle data challenges and deliver business solutions.  I develop and communicate business insights using Excel, R, Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.

Thanks for viewing my posts, and feel free to reach out to me on social media or email.
